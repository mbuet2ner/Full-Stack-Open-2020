# Full Stack Open 2020

> Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

This repository contains my code for the excellent ["Full Stack Open 2020"](https://fullstackopen.com/en) course from the University of Helsinki.
